# Cryptocurrency_Price_Prediction
The Cryptocurrency Price Prediction model uses machine learning and deep learning concept to predict the value of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
## Bitcoin Price forecasting with LSTM and GRU
Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency. This means it is not governed by any central bank or some other authority. This cryptocurrency was created in the 2009 year but it becomes extremely popular in the 2017 year. Some experts call bitcoin "the currency of the future" or even lead it as an example of the social revolution. The bitcoin price has increased several times during the 2017 year. At the same time, it is very volatile. Many economic entities are interested in tools for forecasting the bitcoin prices. It is especially important for existing or potential investors and for government structures. The last needs to be ready for significant price movements to prepare consistent economic policy. So, the demand for Bitcoin price prediction mechanism is high.

This notebook demonstrates the prediction of the bitcoin price by the neural network model. We are using 2-layers long short term memory (LSTM) as well as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture of the Recurrent neural network (RNN). You can read more about these types of NN here:
